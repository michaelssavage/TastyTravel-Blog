        <p>Isochrones are added on top of the map and they change in reponse to the option 
          the user makes. Walking, cycling, or driving.<p>
        <p>What we want to focus on now is returning Points of Interest and then saving 
          those places to firebase.</p>

        <p>Lectures are all finished and the main priority is the year project with 3 weeks left.</p>

        <p>The user can now enter 2 coordinates and the locations will be added as markers onto the map.
          We want to have the geocoding and autocomplete to be working for convenience.
        </p>
        <p>We decided to re-think our approach to getting the current location and would not focus on it for the minute.
          It was not as straight-forward as we thought it would be. </p>

        <p> We created a logo ourselves and loved it.</p>

        <p>Being able to delete accounts has been added today. Plenty of work has been done on the design of the different home
          pages. Now that lectures are finished, we aim to start implementing the Mapbox features.</p>

        <p>Signing in and signing up using Firebase was added by Gerard. By following the website documentation and Youtube tutorials we got it working.</p>
        
        <p>It caused a lot of frustration but it relieved some stress.</p>

        <p>Integrated mapbox into the project. The coordinates of Dublin city were added. Felt like a small success getting it working.</p>

        <p>After two weeks of exams and a long break away from the project, the first commit to Gitlab for Android Studio was made. It included the initial screen created from the mockups. We are only six weeks out so a lot of learning needs to be done.</p>

        <p>Nearly finished writing the specification of our app. We organised a meeting with Mark so that we can stay on track. Talk about the presentation and what we have to continue doing.</p>

        <p>We had our Five minute presentation with Monica Ward and David Sinclair. They accepted our project but with a lot of hassles..
        <ul>        
          <li>Need to add user profile, with possibly a filter.</li>
          <li>Need to be able to stand over UX design and testing.</li>
          <li>Have to be careful with database design.</li>
          <li>Need to make it complex.</li>

        <p class ="date">Thurs, Oct 31</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The first submission is due tomorrow, the 1st of November. We have to have our project proposal finished and a supervisor confirmed. 
          We were a bit anxious this week because our mentor had not been replying to emails only for us to find out he had been away the previous few days. 
        <p>Our fault.</p>
        <p>We organised a meeting for today and he was willing to supervise! Great!</p>

        <p>Unsurprisingly, picking a project title was difficult. We decided on TastyTravel after a lot of thought because of how simple it is and it has nice alliteration.</p>

        <p>We decided during the week that Mark Roantree would be great as our mentor because he gives good constructive criticism.
          We had him as a lecturer in 1st year and felt he would be the best option.</p>

        <p>We met him today to talk over our project and as we expected, he was honest about our project's weaknesses. 
        The main points of the meeting were that we had to use an ALGORITHM and not just rely on API's.
        We felt some confidence coming out of that meeting.</p>

        <p>Our First introduction to the 3rd year project was given today. David Sinclair discussed
          what was expected from all of us. It seems like a lot of work and quite scary but we will 
          tackle each problem as they come.</p>
